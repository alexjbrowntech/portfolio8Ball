# Portfolio Project - Magic 8 Ball API

## About Project

- This came from a one day long hackathon created by a team of three as part of the School of Code bootcamp.
- We were given a brief on Friday morning and had until the afternoon to put together an API
  - CRUD functionality
  - Tested and demonstrable responses (with the understanding this was created within a few hours and general functionality was preferable as proof-of-concept over polished perfection)
  - I am planning to implment this into my [portfolio site](yamyamalex.netlify.app) (this is still in development) and this repo is a copy I have made of the team hackathon as it needs some refinement to weave into the portfolio code

## How it's made

- This is a simple API where the responses are stored in magicresponses.json
  - For ease of readability the functions are separated out into responseFunctions.js to make it easier to read what code is doing what action
  - As this was original made early in the bootcamp, there are comments on almost every line as part of our learning process, now that I am more confident with the code I would only leave comments at the top of a section to 'title' it but at the time this was best practice for a group of new learners to be sure we knew what we were writing and could justify it's inclusion to the codebase.

## Meet the Team

- The team for this hackathon were:
  - Alexander Brown, Hannah McCabe, Christopher Ndibe
